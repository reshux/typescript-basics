# TypeScript Basics

This repo containts .ts files where I learn TypeScript basics. I tried commenting the code for those who might be interested in trying these out!

The rest-api subdirectory contains an API request service. Don't forget to `npm install` before playing around with it. You can run this little request service by doing `npm start username`, where `username` can be any GitHub user you want.
